Welcome! We know how stressful and how confusing buying, holding, purchasing crypto can be. We hope this document site may be a guide for you to learn about cryptocurrency, especially Electra or ECA as we call it, educate yourself more about cryptocurrency, and finally grow in your knowledge and skill of using cryptocurrency.

Some of this documentation may be not be 100% correct but it aims to give you a solid basic foundation. I welcome any suggestions to make changes to the website. This website it made for you! We realize the more you know, the more you will want to hold of ECA.

Thank you for stoping by and enjoy!
