## Backing Up wallet.dat In Electra Protocol QT Wallet

This process is very simple for those who use Windows on a regular basis. These steps are done from the top menu of the Electra Protocol QT Wallet program.

Windows & Linux:
```
File --> Backup Wallet
```
Save the file as any name but remember, if you ever need to restore it, you have to rename it back to wallet.dat.

For MacOS, it is slightly different. Follow the steps below:

1. Click on the Electra Protocol QT Wallet program so that it is active on your screen.
2. In the very top of the screen, select the menu option, "Electra Protocol" (should be very top left)
3. Go to Backup Wallet

The video below is on Windows but Linux has the same menu.
