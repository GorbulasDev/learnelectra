## FAQ
Below is a list of commonly asked questions about Electra Protocol or the XEP Wallet. We have tried to answer them to the best of our ability. (Click on the question text to expand the answer)

<details><summary>When will Electra Protocol incorporate Masternodes?</summary>
<p>
<br />
Masternodes will not be supported but we will have validator nodes. Validator nodes are more focused on security than masternodes.

<details><summary>Where are the staking pools at?</summary>
<p>
<br />
As the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins. With staking pools, the person who runs them has the private keys. This allows them to access your coins at ANY time and stake them how they wish or even move your coins. Yes, everyone wants to make more XEP! But at the expense to have your coins vulnerable, the Electra Protocol Team does not support it. This is not stopping individuals to make their own staking pools but this is why we do not support voting on those type of listings. As it is common if something happens to a user's coins, Electra Protocol Team is blamed. Stay safe and hold your own coins.

<details><summary>I want to help with the project, but I am not that good at coding. How can I help?</summary>
<p>
<br />
This project needs a ton of volunteers from project managers, coders, support team, documentation writers, marketers, etc. You have any skill using a computer or with coordinating projects, we could use your help! We want to get to know you first so show some support and have discussions on our main forms of communication. Then let us know your interested in helping out. Do note, that being on the team doesn't give you "secret access" or anything like that.
