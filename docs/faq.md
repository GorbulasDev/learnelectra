Below is a list of commonly asked questions about Electra or the Electra QT Wallet. We have tried to answer them to the best of our ability. (Click on the question text to expand the answer)

<details><summary>When will Electra incorporate Masternodes?</summary>
<p>
<br />
At this time, masternodes will not be supported. This is due to the current supply and the rewards of the masternodes will not offset the cost of hosting. Our chain at this point is highly stable and thus masternodes are not needed.

<details><summary>I have stakes that are showing up red or I just recently upgrade from an old wallet and my stakes are not valid. Help!</summary>
<p>
<br />
You have been staking on the old blockchain. In order to be rewarded with coins that are valid on our current chain you need to use a current supported wallet. Doing staking on the blockchain is protecting the network. When you protect the network and your using an old unsupported wallet, your are protecting a different chain and thus the coins do not exist on our current chain as we have had two hard forks since October 2018.

<details><summary>Why does the Mobile Wallets not support staking??</summary>
<p>
<br />
It's not possible with current technology. As they need to be online and current. The mobile wallet only downloads what are called headers so it is simple and lite wallet. This allows for the fast sync. If your mobile wallet did support it, the cpu on the mobile device would be hot most of the time. The mobile wallet's purpose is more for spending like a wallet you may keep on your person. To stake, you also need to leave your coins untouched too.

<details><summary>Where are the staking pools at?</summary>
<p>
<br />
As the saying goes, not your keys, not your coins. With staking pools, the person who runs them has the private keys. This allows them to access your coins at ANY time and stake them how they wish or even move your coins. Yes, everyone wants to make more Electra! But at the expense to have your coins vulnerable, the Electra Team does not support it. This is not stopping individuals to make their own staking pools but this is why we do not support voting on those type of listings. As it is common if something happens to a user's coins, Electra Team is blamed. Stay safe and hold your own coins.

<details><summary>I want to help with the project, but I am not that good at coding. How can I help?</summary>
<p>
<br />
This project needs a ton of volunteers from project managers, coders, support team, documentation writers, marketers, etc. You have any skill using a computer or with coordinating projects, we could use your help! We want to get to know you first so show some support and have discussions on our main forms of communication. Then let us know your interested in helping out. Do note, that being on the team doesn't give you "secret access" or anything like that.
