## Backing Up the Wallet In XEP Core Wallet

This process is very simple for those who use Windows on a regular basis. These steps are done from the top menu of the XEP Core Wallet program.

Windows, Mac & Linux:
```
File --> Backup Wallet
```
Save the file as any name but remember, if you ever need to restore it. Highly recommend to back it up to a USB device.
