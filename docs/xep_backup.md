## Backing Up the Wallet In XEP Core Wallet

This process is very simple for those who use Windows on a regular basis. These steps are done from the top menu of the XEP Core Wallet program.

Windows & Linux:
```
File --> Backup Wallet
```
Save the file as any name but remember, if you ever need to restore it. Highly recommend to back it up to a USB device.

For MacOS, it is slightly different. Follow the steps below:

1. Click on the XEP Core Wallet program so that it is active on your screen.
2. In the very top of the screen, select the menu option, "XEP Core" (should be very top left)
3. Go to Backup Wallet
4. Save the wallet to your computer, USB device, or combination of both.
