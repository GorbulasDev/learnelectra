## How to Restore an Electra QT Wallet from a backed up wallet.dat file

If you have a backed up wallet.dat file, you can use this method below to replace a current wallet.dat file. You need to have the Electra QT Wallet downloaded first, installed, and ran at least once.

The instructions below are to accomplish these steps. You may also use the video as a guide to help out further. 

**NOTE**
During this process NEVER do the following:

1. Give your wallet.dat to anyone. I mean ANYONE.
2. Opening your wallet.dat as a file and trying to edit it or view it, may corrupt it. Do not edit this file. Only move, copy, and paste the file.
3. Create backups of backups in different locations (USB stick, computer, different hard drive, etc)

### Follow These Steps

1. Click on the link [HERE](test1.md) to find the appropriate method to find your Electra folder.
2. Inside the Electra folder, you will have the wallet.dat file that needs to be replaced when your backed up copy.
3. Make sure Electra QT Wallet is fully closed, then replace the wallet.dat (keep in mind wallet.dat needs to have the EXACT name as wallet.dat)
4. Restart the Electra QT Wallet and allow a full sync to see any coins if you had them in the previous wallet.dat.
