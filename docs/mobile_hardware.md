## Mobile Wallets

Yep

### Android Wallets

Our highly-rated Android wallet can be downloaded from here: [Android Electra Wallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.electraproject)

### iOS Wallets

Nope, nada, zilch

## Hardware Wallets

One to Rule Them All

### Ellipal

Yep

### Ledger

Maybe Someday

### Trezor

Maybe Never

## Paper Wallets

This paper wallet is hosted and created on a 3rd party website which means the Electra Project does not officially support this page. We will certainly help you import your keys when this used but the Electra Team has nothing to do with this page. Use at your own risk!
