## Hardware Wallets

As of current, we have the Ellipal wallet that is the hardware wallet we recommend to users. Ledger and Trezor intergration are in work right now. We undertsand this has taken us some time but navigating support and intergration can be compared to a maze. Please be patient with us.

## Paper Wallets

This paper wallet is hosted and created on a 3rd party website which means the Electra Project does not officially support this page. We will certainly help you import your keys when this used but the Electra Team has nothing to do with this page. Use at your own risk!
