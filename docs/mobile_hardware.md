## Hardware Wallets

As of current, we are waiting for the Ellipal team to add XEP to their wallet. Ledger and Trezor integration are in work right now. We understand this has taken us some time but navigating support and integration can be compared to a maze. Please be patient with us.

### Ellipal

Note we have not been added to the Ellipal wallet yet. You still may purchase it from this website: [Ellipal Cold Wallet](https://www.ellipal.com)
