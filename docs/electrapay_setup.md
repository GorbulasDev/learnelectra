## How to Install and Setup the ElectraPay WordPress Plugin

ElectraPay WordPress plugin is an easy to install WordPress plugin. WooCommerce must be installed as well before installing this plugin. At this time, the plugin is not listed on the WordPress plugin page, which is due to the fact that the Electra development team is working to create a product before submitting it to be included on the WordPress Plugin page.
