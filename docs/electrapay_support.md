### Is KYC (Know Your Customer) needed to use ElectraPay?
No, KYC will not be used as ElectraPay does not use any fiat currencies. Though this may change in the future for certain laws, we are aware you want to keep your information private. Please note, we do want you to enter is basic information for the sole purpose that businesses can know who they may be working with.

### Do ElectraPay accounts provide staking?
No, ElectraPay is meant to be used for transactions. Staking requires your coins to not be moved around for a period of time thus, it would not make sense to have staking.

ElectraPay is a gateway for payment, not an online store. We have ways to easily incorporate ElectraPay into your current payment gateways, especially if you currently use WordPress.

As ElectraPay does not use the actual QT wallet, it's very safe. Just keep you keys and passwords safe as always.

### Can someone not authorized get into my account?
No, only if you give them password to access it.

### Does the Electra Team have access to my account?
No! This is why it is very important to keep your passwords safe!
